# ðŸš€ Gemini AI Screen Assistant

---

## Project Overview

The **Gemini AI Screen Assistant** is an innovative solution that integrates **Computer Vision (OCR)** and **Artificial Intelligence (Gemini API)** to automate text extraction from screen captures and generate instant, relevant responses. This project was developed to optimize workflows by providing a direct bridge between a user's on-screen visual content and Google Gemini's advanced natural language processing capabilities.

It's a powerful tool for anyone needing quick and accurate answers from visual information, ranging from troubleshooting technical issues to querying data in documents or images, **especially useful for scenarios where direct text copying from the screen is restricted (e.g., protected websites, image-only content, certain PDFs).**

## Core Functionalities

* **Automatic Capture and Analysis:** Monitors a designated screenshots directory (e.g., default "Screenshots" folder) and automatically processes the most recent image.
* **Precise Text Extraction (OCR):** Leverages `tesseract.js` to convert image-based text into digital format, ensuring high accuracy in content extraction. This is **critical for extracting text from sources that prevent traditional copy-pasting**, such as protected web pages or text embedded in images.
* **Intelligent Response Generation with Gemini AI:** Sends the extracted text to Google's `gemini-2.0-flash` model, yielding concise and direct answers.
* **Automatic Clipboard Copy:** The Gemini-generated response is automatically copied to the system clipboard (`clipboardy`), allowing for instant pasting into any application.
* **Automation and Optimization:** Eliminates the need for manual text copying and question formulation, streamlining tasks and boosting productivity.

## Technologies Utilized

This project demonstrates proficiency and familiarity with a modern and relevant tech stack for AI and automation solutions development:

* **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime environment for the backend.
* **Google Gemini API (`@google/generative-ai`):** Direct access to Google's cutting-edge AI models for natural language processing.
* **Tesseract.js:** JavaScript library for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), ensuring robust text extraction from images.
* **`dotenv`:** For secure management of environment variables (e.g., API keys).
* **`fs` (File System) & `path`:** Native Node.js modules for file and directory manipulation.
* **`clipboardy`:** For programmatic interaction with the system clipboard.

## Getting Started

To run the Gemini AI Screen Assistant locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK]
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure your Google Gemini API key:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
    ```
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```
    Obtain your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
4.  **Run the assistant:**
    ```bash
    node index.js
    ```
    The assistant will begin monitoring your "Screenshots" folder (typically located on your Desktop).

## Potential Use Cases

* **Circumventing Copy Restrictions:** Easily extract text from websites or documents that block standard copy-paste functionalities.
* **Students:** Get quick answers to questions from textbooks, tests, or slides that might be image-based.
* **Professionals:** Extract information from reports, invoices, or charts and get instant analysis, even when the content is not selectable.
* **Developers/Technical Support:** Copy error messages or code snippets from images and receive solutions or explanations.
* **General Users:** Automate information retrieval from any visual content on their screen.
